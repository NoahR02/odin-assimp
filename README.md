# Odin Assimp
Original Author: https://github.com/ErrorOnUsername/skoll/blob/main/lib/assimp/wrapper.odin

## Build
### Windows:
``` .\build.bat ```

Place the `assimp-vc143-mt.dll` next to ***your executable***.

I tried renaming the .lib and .dll, but it would give me a linking error, so the default name is staying for now.

### Linux:
``` ./build.sh ```
